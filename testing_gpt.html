            1  1.1 Introduction :   As studied earlier, the solid  state of matter is characterised by   strong  interparticle forces of attraction. As a result  most solids have definite shape and volume,  which   change   only   slightly   with   change  in   temperature   and   pressure. The   smallest  constituent   particles   of   various   solids   are  atoms ,   ions   or   molecules . All such smallest  constituent particles of solids will be referred  to as ' particles ' in this chapter.  1.2 Types of solids :   There are two types  of   solids,   namely   crystalline   solids   and  amorphous solids.  1. SOLID STATE  Can you recall ?  •   What are the three most common  states of matter?  •   How does solid state differ from the  other two states ? (Answer with reference  to volume, shape, effect of temperature  and pressure on these and the motion  of constituent particles and interparticle  forces.)  1.2.1   Crystalline   solids   :   Study   of   many  crystalline solids indicates that they possess  the following characteristic properties.  i.   There is a   regularity   and   periodicity   in  the arrangement of constituent particles in  crystalline solids. The ordered arrangement  of particles extends over a long range.  ii.   Crystalline   solids   have   sharp   melting  points , that is, they melt at a definite  temperature.  iii. All   crystalline   substances   except   those  having cubic structure are   anisotropic . In  other words their properties like refractive  index, thermal and electrical conductivity,  etc, are different in different directions.  Ice, salts such as NaCl, metals such  as sodium, gold, copper and materials such  as diamond, graphite, ceramics are examples  of crystalline solids.  Observe and discuss...  •   Collect   the   following   solids   :  grannular   sugar,   common   salt,  blue vitriol.  •   Observe a few grannules of these solids  under a magnifying lens or microscope.  •   Discuss your observations with reference  to the following points : (i) Shape of the  grannules, (ii) Smoothness of faces of  the grannules and (iii) Angles between  various edges of the grannules.  •   All the above solids are crystalline solids.  Name the properties of crystals that you  observed in this activity.  Try this...  Observe the above figure carefully.  The two types of circles in this figure  represent two types of constituent particles  of a solid.  •   Will you call the arrangement of particles  in this solid regular or irregular ?  •   Is   the   arrangement   of   constituent  particles same or different in directions  →  AB ,   →  CD , and   →  EF   ?
2  1.2.3 Isomorphism and polymorphism  Similarity   or   dissimilarity   in   crystal  structure of different solids is described as  isomorphism and polymorphism.  i. Isomorphism :   Two or more substances  having the same crystal structure are said to be  isomorphous. In these substances the chemical  composition has the same atomic ratio. For  example (i) NaF and MgO (ii) NaNO 3   and  CaCO 3   are isomorphous pairs, and have the  same atomic ratios, 1:1 and 1:1:3, respectively,  of the constituent atoms.  ii. Polymorphism :   A single substance that  exists in two or more forms or crystalline  structures   is   said   to   be   polymorphous.  Polymorphs of a substance are formed under  different conditions. For example : Calcite and  aragonite are two forms of calcium carbonate;  α -quartz,   b -quartz and cristobalite are three  of the several forms of silica. Polymorphism  occuring in elements is called   allotropy . For  example: three polymorphic (allotropic) forms  of carbon are diamond, graphite and fullerene.  1.2.2 Amorphous solids :   The particles of  a liquid are in constant motion. The stop  action photograph of a liquid describes the  amorphous state. In fact, they are supercooled  liquids. Amorphous solids have the following  characteristics.  i.   The   constituent   particles   in   amorphous  solids   are   randomly   arranged .   The  particles do not have long range ordered  structure, but they do have a short range  order.  ii.   Amorphous   solids   do   not   have   sharp  melting   points.   They   melt   gradually  over   a   temperature   interval .   On  heating, amorphous solids gradually and  continuously soften and start to flow.  iii.   These   solids   are   isotropic .   In   other  words, their properties such as refractive  index, conductivity are all independent of  direction of measurement. They exhibit the  same magnitude for any property in every  direction.  Use your brain power  Identify the arrangements A and B  as crystalline or amorphous.  Glass, plastic, rubber, tar, and metallic glass  (metal-metalloid alloy) are a few examples of  amorphous solids.  Do you know ?  •   A   single   crystal   has   ordered  (regular   and   periodic)  arrangement   of   constituent   particles  throughout its bulk.  •   Majority of crystalline solids, including  metals,   are   polycrystalline   in   nature.  Single   grannule   of   a   polycrystalline  solid is made of many single crystals or  crystallites packed together with different  orientations.  •   Single crystals are difficult to obtain.  Diamond   is   an   example   of   naturally  formed single crystal.
3  Can you recall ?  •   What   are   structures   of  diamond and graphite ?  •   What are the types of covalent bonds  those link carbon atoms in diamond  and graphite ?  •   Are   all   the   valence   electrons   of  carbon atoms in graphite localized to  specific covalent bonds ?  Try this...  Graphite is a covalent solid  yet   soft   and   good   conductor   of  electricity. Explain.  1.3   Classification   of   crystalline   solids   :  Crystalline solids are further classified into  four categories : ionic solids, covalent network  solids, molecular solids and metallic solids.  1.3.1 Ionic crystals :   Ionic crystals have the  following characteristics :  i.   The constituent particles of ionic crystals  are   charged ions . The cations and anions  may differ in size.  ii.   Each ion of a given sign of charge is  bonded to ions of opposite charge around  it by coulomb force. In other words, the  particles   of   ionic   crystals   are   held   by  electrostatic force of attraction   between  oppositely charged ions.  iii. Ionic crystals are   hard   and   brittle . They  have   high melting points .  iv.   These are   nonconductors   of electricity  in solid state. However, they are good  conductors when melted or dissolved in  water.  For example : NaCl, K 2 SO 4 , CaF 2 , KCl are  ionic crystals.  1.3.2 Covalent network crystals  Characteristics of covalent network crystals  are as follows :  i.   The   constituent   particles   in   covalent  network solids are   atoms .  ii. The atoms in these crystals are linked by a  continous system of   covalent bonds . The  result is a rigid three dimensional network  that forms a giant molecule. The entire  crystal is a single molecule.  iii. As a result of rigid and strongly bonded  structure,   covalent   network   crystals   are  very hard . In fact they are the hardest and  most   incompressible   of all the materials.  These   crystals   have   high   melting   and  boiling points .  iv. The electrons are localised in covalent  bonds and hence are not mobile. As a  result, covalent solids are   poor conductors  of heat and electricity.  For example : diamond, quartz (SiO 2 ), boron  nitride,   carborandum   are   covalent   network  solids.  Do you know ?  Many   crystalline   forms   of  silica (SiO 2 ) are found in nature.  Three of them are   α -quartz,   b -quartz and  cristobalite  cristobalite   α -quartz  b -quartz  Do you know ?  Diamond is the hardest known  material.
4  1.3.3 Molecular crystals :   Substances such  as Cl 2 , CH 4 , H 2 , CO 2 , O 2   on solidfication  give molecular crystals.   Crystalline organic  compounds are also molecular solids.  i.   The   constituent   particles   of   molecular  solids are   molecules   (or unbonded single  atoms) of the same substance.  c.   Intermolecular   hydrogen   bonds   in  solids such as H 2 O (ice), NH 3 , HF and  so forth.  iii. Because of weak intermolecular attractive  forces, molecular solids are usually soft  substances with   low melting points .  iv. These solids are   poor electrical conductors  and are good insulators.  1.3.4 Metallic crystals :   These are crystalline  solids formed by atoms of the same metallic  element, held together by a metallic bond.  Metallic bond :   In a solid metal, the valence  electrons are delocalised over the entire crystal  leaving behind positively charged metal ions.  Therefore, metallic crystals are often described  as an array of positive ions immersed in a sea  of mobile electrons. The attractive interactions  between cations and mobile electrons constitute  the metallic bonds. (For more details refer to  section 1.9.2)  Metallic crystals have the following properties:  i.   Metals are   malleable , that is, they can be  hammered into thin sheets.  ii.   Metals are   ductile , that is, they can be  drawn into wires.  iii. Metals have   good electrical and thermal  conductivity .  Examples : metals such as Na, K, Ca, Li, Fe,  Au, Ag, Co, etc.  The properties of different types of crystalline  solids are summarized in Table 1.1.  1.4 Crystal structure :   The ordered three  dimensional   arrangement   of   particles   in   a  crystal is described using two terms, namely,  lattice and basis.  1.4.1 Crystal, lattice and basis :   Lattice is a  geometrical arrangement of points in a three  dimensional periodic array. A crystal structure  is obtained by attaching a constituent particle  to each of the lattice points. Such constituent  particles that are attached to the lattice points  form the basis of the crystal lattice. Crystal  Can you recall ?  What is a hydrogen bond ?  Remember...  Both   ionic   and   covalent  crystals are hard and have high  melting   and   boiling   points.   We   can  use   electrical   properties   to   distinguish  between them. Both are insulators at low  temperature.  Ionic solids become good conductors  only   at   high   temperature,   above   their  melting points.  The conductivity of covalent solids  is   in   general   low   and   increases   with  temperature. However, there is no abrupt  rise   in   conductivity   when   substance   is  melted.  ii.   The   bonds   within   the   molecules   are  covalent. The molecules are held together  by   various   intermolecular   forces   of  attraction . (Refer to XI Std. Chemistry  Textbook, Chapter 10). For example :  a.   Weak dipole-dipole interactions   in  polar molecules such as solid HCl,  H 2 O, SO 2 , which possess permanent  dipole moment.  b.   Very   weak   dispersion   or   London  forces   in nonpolar molecules such as  solid CH 4 , H 2 . These forces are also  involved   in   monoatomic   solids   like  argon,   neon.   (These   substances   are  usually gases at room temperature.)
5  lattice is also called space lattice of crystal.  Thus, crystal is the structure that results by  attaching a basis to each of the lattice points.  It is represented by the following equation.

This basic pattern is repeated in three  dimensions   to   generate   the   entire   crystal.  The smallest repeating structural unit of a  crystalline solid is called unit cell .  When the unit cells are stacked together  to generate the crystal, each unit cell shares  its faces, edges and corners with neighbouring  unit cells. It is important to understand that the  geometric shape of a unit cell is same as that  of the macroscopic crystal. For example, if the  crystal has cubic shape the unit cell will also  have its constituent particles arranged to form  a tiny cube.  The dimensions of unit cell along the three  axes are denoted by the symbols a, b and c.  The angles between these axes are represented  by the symbols   ∝ ,   b   and   γ   as shown in Fig 1.1.  1.4.3 Types of unit cell :   There are four types  of unit cells.  i. Primitive or simple unit cell :   In primitive  unit cell, the constituent particles are present at  its corners only.  ii. Body-centred unit cell :   In   this   type   of  unit cell, one constituent particle is present at  the centre of its body in addition to the corner  particles.  +   =  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

6  iii. Face-centred unit cell :   This   unit   cell  consists of particles at the centre of each of the  faces in addition to the corner particles.  iv. Base-centred unit cell :   This unit cell  consists of particles at the centre of any two  of its opposite faces in addition to the corner  particles.  1.4.4   Crystal   systems   :   By   mathematical  analysis, it has been proved that only fourteen  different kinds of space lattices are possible.  In other words, there are only 14 ways in  which similar points can be arranged in a  three dimensional order. These 14 lattices,  which describe the crystal structure, are called  Bravais lattices .  Fourteen Bravais lattices are divided  into   seven   crystal   systems.   The   possible  combinations of lattice point spacings (a, b  and c) along three axes and the angles ( ∝ ,   b  and   γ ) between these axes give rise to seven  crystal systems. In other words, seven crystal  systems are associated with 14 Bravais lattices  also called 14 unit cells.  The   seven   crystal   systems   are  named as cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic,  rhombohedral,   monoclinic,   triclinic   and  hexagonal   system.   Cubic   system   will   be  discussed in the following section.  1.5 Cubic system :   There are three kinds of  unit cells in cubic system : primitive or simple  cubic (sc), body-centred cubic (bcc) and face-  centred cubic (fcc) (Fig. 1.2).  i. Simple cubic unit cell   (sc)   has a particle at  each of the eight corners of a cube.  ii. Body-centred cubic unit cell   (bcc)   has  particles at its eight corners and an additional  particle in the center of the cube.  iii. Face-centred cubic unit cell   (fcc)   has  particle at the centre of each of six faces in  addition to the particles at eight corners of the  cube.  Fig. 1.2 : Cubic unit cell  sc  sc  sc  bcc  bcc  bcc  fcc  fcc  fcc  1.5.1 Number of particles in cubic unit cells  i. Primitive or simple cubic unit cell (sc) :  A simple cubic cell has particles at its eight  corners. When these unit cells are stacked  together, particle at each corner of a given unit  cell is shared with seven other neighbouring  cubes that come together at that corner. As a  result the corner particle contributes its 1/8 th  part to the given unit cell. Thus, a   simple cubic  cell has   1/8 × 8 =   1   particle per unit cell .  ii. Body-centred cubic unit cell (bcc) :   A  bcc unit cell has eight corner particles and an  additional particle at the centre of the cube.  One eighth of each particle from eight corners  belongs to the given unit cell as mentioned in  simple cubic unit cell.  The particle at the centre of a given  cube is not shared by any other cube. Hence, it  belongs entirely to the given unit cell. Thus bcc  unit cell has one particle from eight corners  plus one particle in the centre of the cube,  making total of   2 particles   per bcc unit cell .  iii. Face-centred cubic unit cell (fcc) :   A  fcc unit cell has particles at the eight corners  plus particles at the centre of its six faces. As  described in simple cubic unit cell, one particle

8  from eight corners belongs to the given unit  cell.  Each particle at the centre of the six  faces is shared with one neighbouring cube.  Thus,1/2 of each face particle belongs to the  given unit cell. From six faces, 1/2 × 6 = 3  particles belong to the given unit cell.  Therefore,   fcc unit cell has   one corner  particle plus 3 face particles,   total 4 particles  per unit cell .  Remember...  Each corner   particle   of a cube  is shared by 8 cubes, each face  particle   is shared by 2 cubes and each edge  particle   is shared by 4 cubes.  Problem 1.1 :   When gold crystallizes, it  forms face-centred cubic cells. The unit cell  edge length is 408 pm. Calculate the density  of gold. Molar mass of gold is 197 g/mol.  Solution :  ρ   =   M n a 3   NA  M   = 197 g mol -1 ,   n   = 4 atoms for fcc,  N A   = 6.022 ×10 23   atoms mol -1 ,  a   = 408 pm = 408 ×10 -12 m = 4.08×10 -8   cm  Substitution   of   these   quantities   in   the  equation gives  ρ   =  197 g mol -1   × 4 atom (4.08×10   -8   )   3   cm 3   × 6.022×10 23   atom mol -1  = 19.27 g/cm 3 ,   19.27   ×   10 3   kg/m 3 . 1.5.2   Relationship   between   molar   mass,  density of the substance and unit cell edge  length, is deduced in the following steps  i. If edge length of cubic unit cell is   a , the  volume of unit cell is   a 3 .  ii. Suppose that mass of one particle is   m   and  that there are   n   particles per unit cell.  Mass of unit cell =   m × n   (1.1)  iii. The density of unit cell ( ρ ), which is same  as density of the substance is given by  ρ   =   mass of unit cell volume of unit cell   =   m×n a 3   = density of  substance  (1.2)  iv. Molar mass ( M ) of the substance is given  by  M   = mass of one particle × number of particles  per mole  =   m×N A   ( N A   is Avogadro number)  Therefore,   m= M/N A   (1.3)  v. Combining Eq. (1.1) and (1.3), gives  ρ   =   n M a 3   N A  (1.4)  By knowing any four parameters of Eq. (1.4),  the fifth can be calculated  1.6 Packing of particles in crystal lattice  Constituent particles of a crystalline  solid   are   close   packed.   While   describing  the   packing   of   particles   in   a   crystal,   the  individual   particles   are   treated   as   hard  spheres. The closeness of particles maximize  the interparticle attractions.  The number of   neighbouring spheres  that touch any given sphere is its coordination  number .   Magnitude   of   the   coordination  number   is   a   measure   of   compactness   of  spheres in close-packed structures. The larger  the coordination number, the closer are the  spheres to each other.  1.6.1 Close packed structures :   The three  dimensional close   packed structure can be  understood conveniently by looking at the  close packing in one and two dimensions.  a. Close packing in one dimension :   A close  packed one dimensional structure results by  arranging the spheres to touch each other in a  row (Fig. 1.3 (a)).  b. Close packing in two dimensions :   A close  packed   two   dimensional   (planar)   structure  results by stacking the rows together such
9  that they are in contact with each other. There  are two ways to obtain close packing in two  dimensions.  i. Square close packing :   One dimensional  rows of close packed spheres are stacked over  each other such that the spheres align vertically  and horizontally (Fig. 1.3 (b)). If the first row  is labelled as 'A' type, being exactly same as  the first row, the second row is also labelled as  'A' type. Hence this arrangement is called A,  A, A, A..... type two dimensional arrangement.  In this arrangement, every sphere touches four  neighbouring spheres. Hence, two dimensional  coordination number, here, is 4. A square is  obtained by joining the centres of these four  closest neighbours (Fig. 1.3(b)). Therefore,  this two dimensional close packing is called  square close packing in two dimension .  ii. Hexagonal close packing :   Close packed  one dimensional row (Fig. 1.3 (a)) shows that  there are depressions between the neighbouring  spheres. If the second row is arranged in such  a way that its spheres fit in the depressions of  the first row, a staggered arrangement results.  If the first row is called 'A' type row, the  second row, being different, is called 'B' type.  Placing the third row in staggered manner in  contact with the second row gives rise to an  arrangement in which the spheres in the third  row are aligned with the spheres in the first  row. Hence the third row is 'A' type. Similarly  spheres in the fourth row will be alligned with  the spheres in the second row and hence the  fourth row would be 'B' type. The resulting two  dimensional arrangement is 'ABAB...' type  (Fig. 1.3 (c)). In this arrangement each sphere  touches six closest neighbours. Thus, the two  dimensional   coordination   number   in   this  packing is 6. A regular hexagon is obtained  by joining the centres of these six closest  spheres (Fig. 1.3 (c)). Hence, this type of two  dimensional close packing is called hexagonal  close packing in two dimensions. Compared to  the square close packing in two dimensions,  the coordination number in hexagonal close  packing in two dimensions is higher. Moreover  the free space in this arrangement is less than  in square packing, making it more efficient  packing than square packing. From Fig.1.3(c)  it is evident that the free spaces (voids) are  triangular in shape. These triangular voids are  of two types. Apex of the triangular voids in  alternate rows points upwards and downwards.  Fig. 1.3 : (a) Close packing in one dimension  (b) square close packing  (c) Hexagonal close packing in two dimension  (a)  (b)  (c)  c.   Close   packing   in   three   dimensions   :  Stacking of two dimensional layers gives rise  to three dimensional crystal structures. Two  dimensional square close packed layers are  found to stack only in one way to give simple  cubic   lattice.   Two   dimensional   hexagonal  close packed layers are found to stack in  two distinct ways. Accordingly two crystal  structures, namely, hexagonal close packed  (hcp) structure and face centred cubic (fcc)  structure are formed.  i. Stacking of square close packed layers:  Stacking   of   square   close   packed   layers  generates a three dimensional simple cubic  structure. Here, the second layer is placed  over the first layer so as to have its spheres  exactly above those of the first layer (Fig. 1.4).  Subsequent square close packed layers are  placed one above the other in the same manner.  In this arrangement, spheres of all the layers  are perfectly aligned horizontally as well as  vertically. Hence, all the layers are alike, and  are labelled as 'A' layers. This arrangement  of layers is described as 'AAAA... ' type. The
10  structure that results on stacking square close  packed layers is   simple cubic . Its unit cell is  the   primitive cubic unit cell   (Fig. 1.4).  Fig. 1.4 : Stacking of square closed packed  layers  It can be seen that in the simple cubic  structure, each sphere touches six neighbouring  spheres, four in its own layer, one in the layer  above and one in the layer below. Hence,  coordination   number   of   each   sphere   is   6.  Polonium is the only metal that crystallizes  in simple cubic closed packed structure.  ii. Stacking of two hexagonal close packed  layers :   To generate a close packed three  dimensional   structure,   hexagonal   close  packed layers are arranged in a particular  manner. In doing so, spheres of the second  layer are placed in the depression of the first  layer (Fig. 1.5). If the first layer is labelled  as 'A' layer, the second layer is labelled as  'B' layer because the two layers are aligned  differently. It is evident from the Fig. 1.5  that all triangular voids of the first layers  are not covered by the spheres of the second  layer. The triangular voids that are covered  by   spheres   of   the   second   layer   generate  tetrahedral void(Fig. 1.6). A tetrahedral void  is surrounded by four spheres. On joining the  centres of these four spheres a tetrahedron is  formed which encloses the tetrahedral voids  (Fig. 1.6). The remaining triangular voids of  the first layer have above them the triangular  voids of the second layer. The overlapping  triangular voids from the two layers together  form an octahedral void which is surrounded  by six spheres (Fig. 1.7).  Fig. 1.6 : Tetrahedral void  Fig. 1.5 : Two layers of closed packed spheres  Remember...  It is important to note that the  triangular shapes of depressions in  A and B layer do not overlap. The apices of  two triangular depressions in A and B layer  point in opposite directions.  The   depressions   in   which   spheres  of second layer rest are tetrahedral voids  while the depressions in which no sphere  rests are octahedral voids.  Fig. 1.7 : Octahedral void
11  1 above and 1 below. Hence coordination  number of any sphere in sc is 6.  b.   In both   hcp   and   ccp/fcc   structures that result  from   stacking   of   hexagonal   close   packed  layers in two different ways, each sphere is  surrounded by 12 neighbouring spheres, 6 in  its own layer, 3 above and 3 below. Hence, the  coordination number of any sphere in hcp or  ccp/fcc structure is 12.  1.6.3 Number of voids per atom in hcp and  ccp :   The tetrahedral and octahedral voids  occur in hcp and ccp/fcc structures. There are  two tetrahedral voids associated with each  atom. The number of octahedral voids is half  that of tetrahedral voids. Thus, there is one  octahedral void per atom.  iii. Placing third hexagonal close packed  layer :   There are two ways of placing the  third hexagonal close packed layer on the  second.  One way   of doing this is to align the  spheres of the third layer with the spheres  of the first layer. The resulting pattern of the  layers will be 'ABAB....'. This arrangement  results   in   hexagonal   close   packed   (hcp)  structure (Fig. 1.8(a)). Metals such as Mg,  Zn, have hcp crystal structure.  The second way   of placing the third  hexagonal close packed layer on the second  is to cover the octahedral voids by spheres of  the third layer. In such placing, the spheres of  the third layer do not align with the spheres  of the second or the spheres of the first layer.  The third layer is, therefore, called 'C' layer.  The spheres of the fourth layer get aligned  with the spheres of the first layer. Hence, the  fourth layer is called 'A' layer. This pattern  of stacking hexagonal close packed layers  is   called   'ABCABC....'.   This   arrangement  results   in cubic close packed (ccp)   structure  (Fig. 1.8(b)). This is same as fcc structure.  Metals such as copper and Ag have ccp (or  fcc) crystal structure.

In the simple cubic (sc) crystal structure,  that results from stacking of square close  packed layers, each sphere is surrounded by  6 neighbouring spheres, 4 in its own layer,  Remember...  If N denotes number of particles,  then number of tetrahedral voids is  2N and that of octahedral voids is N.  1.7 Packing efficiency :   Like coordination  number, the magnitude of packing efficiency  gives a measure of how tightly particles are  packed together.  Packing efficiency is the fraction or a  percentage of the total space occupied by the  spheres (particles).  Packing efficiency =  volume occupied by particles in unit cell total volume of unit cell   ×100  (1.5)  1.7.1   Packing   efficiency   of   metal   crystal  in simple cubic lattice   is obtained by the  following steps.  Step 1 : Radius of sphere   :   In simple cubic  unit cell, particles (spheres) are at the corners  and touch each other along the edge. A face of  simple cubic unit cell is shown in Fig. 1.9. It is  evident that  a   = 2 r   or   r   =   a /2   (1.6)  where r is the radius of atom and ‘a’ is the  length of unit cell edge.
12  Step 2 : Volume of sphere :   Volume of a  sphere = (4/3 π)( r 3 ). Substitution for   r   from  Eq. (1.6) gives  Volume of one particle  = (4/3 π)   ( a /2) 3   =   π a 3  6   (1.7)  Step 3 : Total volume of particles :   Because  simple   cubic   unit   cell   contains   only   one  particle,  volume occupied by particle in unit cell =   π a 3  6  Step 4 : Packing efficiency  Packing efficiency  =   volume occupied by particle in unit cell total volume of unit cell   × 100  =   π a 3 /6  a 3   × 100 =   100π  6   =   100   ×   3.142  6   = 52.36%  Thus, in simple cubic lattice, 52.36 % of  total space is occupied by particles and 47.64%  is empty space, that is, void volume.  1.7.2 Packing efficiency of metal crystal in  body-centred cubic lattice  Step 1 : Radius of sphere (particle) :  In bcc unit cell, particles occupy the corners  and in addition one particle is at the centre of  the cube. Figure 1.10 shows that the particle  at the centre of the cube touches two corner  particles   along   the   diagonal   of   the   cube.  To   obtain   radius   of   the   particle   (sphere)  Pythagorus theorem is applied.  •   For triangle FED,   ∠   FED = 90 0 .  ∴   FD 2   = FE 2   + ED 2   =   a 2   +a 2   = 2 a 2   (because  FE = ED =   a )   (1.8)  •   For triangle AFD,   ∠   ADF =   90 0  ∴   AF 2   = AD 2   + FD 2   (1.9)  Substitution of Eq. (1.8) into Eq. (1.9) yields  AF 2   =   a 2   + 2 a 2   = 3 a 2   (because AD =   a )  or AF =   3   a   (1.10)  The Fig. 1.10 shows that AF = 4 r .  Substitution for AF from equation (1.10) gives  3 a   = 4 r   and hence,   r   =   3 4   a   (1.11)  Step 2 : Volume of sphere :   Volume of sphere  particle = 4/3   π   r 3 . Substitution for   r   from  Eq. (1.11), gives  volume of one particle =   4 3   π   (   3 /4 a ) 3  =   4 3   π   ×   ( 3) 3 64   a 3  =   π   a 3  16 3  Step 3 : Total volume of particles :   Unit  cell bcc contains 2 particles. Hence, volume  occupied by particles in bcc unit cell  = 2 ×   2   3   π a 3  16  =   3   π a 3  8   (1.12)  Fig. 1.10 : bcc unit cell  Fig. 1.9 : Face of simple cubic unit cell  a  r   r
13  Step 4 : Packing efficiency  Packing efficiency  =   volume occupied by particles in unit cell total volume of unit cell   ×100  =   π a 3  8 a3  3   × 100 = 68 %  Thus, 68% of the total volume in bcc unit  lattice is occupied by atoms and 32 % is empty  space or void volume.  1.7.3 Packing efficiency of metal crystal  in face-centred cubic lattice (or ccp or hcp  lattice)  Step 1 : Radius of particle/sphere :   The corner  particles are assumed to touch the particle at  the centre of face ABCD as shown in Fig. 1.11.  The   triangle   ABC   is   right   angled  with   ∠ ABC = 90 0 . According to Pythagorus  theorem,  AC 2   = AB 2   + BC 2   =   a 2   +a 2   = 2 a 2  =   4 3   π   a 3   ×   (   2 1 2   ) 3  =   π   a 3  12 2  Step 3 : Total volume of particles :   The unit  cell of fcc lattice contains 4 particles. Hence,  volume occupied by particles in fcc unit cell  = 4 ×   π   a 3  12 2   =   π   a 3  3 2  Step   4   :   Packing   efficiency   :   Packing  efficiency  =   volume occupied by particles in unit cell total volume of unit cell   × 100  =   π a 3  3 2 a 3   × 100 =   π  3 2   × 100 = 74%  Thus in fcc/ccp/hcp crystal lattice, 74% of the  total volume is occupied by particles and 26%  is void volume or empty space.  Table 1.3 shows the expressions for  various parameters of particles in terms of unit  cell dimension for cubic systems.  Fig. 1.11 : fcc unit cell  (because AB = BC =   a )  Hence, AC =   2   a   (1.13)  Figure 1.11 shows that AC = 4   r . Substitution  for AC from Eq. (1.13) gives  2 a   = 4 r   or   r   =   2  4   a   =   2  a  2   (1.14)  Step 2 : Volume of sphere :   Volume of one  particle =   4 3   π r 3 . Substitution for   r   from  Eq. (1.14) gives  Volume of one particle =   4 3   π   (   2 a 2   ) 3  Use your brain power  Which   of   the   three   lattices,   sc,  bcc and fcc has the most efficient  packing of   particles ?

Density ( ρ )  and molar mass (M) of a metal are related  to each other through unit cell parameters as  shown below :  ρ   =   mass volume  =   number of particles in unit cell volume of unit cell   ×   M N   A  ∴ρ   =   n a   3   ×   M N   A  ∴ M   =   ρ   a3N A n  where 'n' is the number of particles in unit cell  and ' a 3 ' is the volume of unit cell.  •   Number of particles in 'x' g metal :  ∴   Molar mass,   M , contains   N A   particles  ∴   x g of metal contains   x N A M   particles.  substitution of   M   gives  Number of particles in 'x' g =  x N A  ρ a 3   N A /n  =   x n  ρ a 3  •   Number of unit cells in 'x' g metal :  ∴   'n' particles correspond to 1 unit cell  ∴   x n  ρ a 3   particles correspond to   x n  ρ a 3   ×   1 n  unit cells.  ∴ Number of unit cells in 'x' g metal =   x  ρ a 3  •   Number of unit cells in volume ' V ' of  metal =   V a 3  Problem 1.2   A compound made of elements  C and D crystallizes in fcc structure. Atoms  of C are present at the corners of the cube.  Atoms of D are at the centres of faces of the  cube. What is the formula of the compound?  Solution:  i. C atoms are present at the 8 corners. The  contribution of each corner atom to the unit  cell is 1/8 atom. Hence, the number of C  atom that belongs to the unit cell = 8×(1/8)  = 1  ii. D atoms are present at the centres of  six   faces   of   unit   cell.   Each   face-centre  atom is shared between two cubes. Hence,  centribution of each face centre atom to the  unit cell is 1/2 atom.  The number of D atoms that belong  to unit cell = 1/2×6 =3  There are one C atom and three D atoms in  the unit cell.  ∴   Formula of compound = CD 3
15  Problem 1.3 :   The unit cell of metallic  silver is fcc. If radius of Ag atom is 144.4  pm, calculate (a) edge length of unit cell(b)  volume of Ag atom, (c) the percent of the  volume of a unit cell, that is occupied by Ag  atoms, (d) the percent of empty space.  Solution:  (a) For fcc unit cell,   r   = 0.3535   a  r   = 144.4 pm = 144.4 × 10 -12   m  = 144.4 × 10 -10   cm  a   =   r  0.3535   =   144.4 × 10 -10   cm 0.3535  = 4.085 × 10 -8   cm  (b) Volume of Ag atom =   4 3   π   r 3  =   4 3   × 3.142 × (144.4 × 10 -10   cm) 3  = 1.261 × 10 -23   cm 3  (c) In fcc unit cell, there are 4 Ag atoms  Volume occupied by 4 Ag atoms  = 4×1.26×10 -23   cm 3  = 5.044 × 10 -23   cm 3  Total volume of unit cell =   a 3  = (4.085×10 -8   cm) 3  = 6.817×10 -23   cm 3  Percent of volume occupied by Ag atoms  =   volume occupied by atoms in unit cell total volume of unit cell   × 100  =   5.044×10 -23   cm 3 6.817×10 -23   cm 3   = 74%  (d) Percent empty space = 100 - 74 = 26%  Problem 1.4 :   A   compound   is   formed  by two elements A and B. The atoms of  element B forms ccp structure. The atoms  of A occupy 1/3rd of tetrahedral voids.  What is the formula of the compound ?  Solution :   The atoms of element B form  ccp structure. The number of tetrahedral  voids generated is twice the number of B  atoms.  Thus, number of tetrahedral voids = 2B  The   atoms   A   occupy   (1/3)   of   these  tetrahedral voids.  Hence, number of A atoms = 2B×1/3  Ratio of A and B atoms = 2/3 B: 1B  = 2/3:1 = 2:3  Formula of compound = A 2 B 3  Problem 1.5 :   Niobium forms bcc structure.  The density of niobium is 8.55 g/cm 3   and  length of unit cell edge is 330.6 pm. How  many atoms and unit cells are present in  0.5 g of niobium?  Solution:  i. Number of atoms in x g niobium =   x n  ρ a 3  x = 0.5 g,   n   = 2 (for bcc structure),  ρ   = 8.55 g/cm 3 ,  a   = 330.6pm = 3.306×10 -8 cm.  Number of atoms in 0.5 g of niobium  =   0.5 g × 2 8.55 g cm -3   × (3.306×10 -8   cm) 3  = 3.25×10 21  ii. Number of unit cells in x g =   x  ρ a 3  Number of unit cells in 0.5 g of niobium  =   0.5 g × 2 8.55 g cm -3   × (3.306×10 -8   cm) 3  = 1.62 ×10 21
16  There are three types of defects: point  defects, line defects and plain defects. Only  point defects will be discussed in this chapter.  1.8.1   Point   defects   :   These   defects   are  irregularities produced in the arrangement of  basis at lattice points in crystalline solids.  There are three major classes of point  defects: stoichiometric point defects, impurity  defects and nonstoichiometric point defects.  a. Stoichiometric point defects :   Chemical  formula of a compound shows fixed ratio of  number of atoms or number of cations and  anions. This fixed ratio is the stoichiometry of  the compound.  In stoichiometric defect, the stoichiometry  remains unchanged. In other words, the ratio  of number of atoms or number of cations and  anions of compound remains the same as  represented by its chemical formula.  There are four types of stoichiometric  point defects: vacancy defect, self interstitial  defect, Schottky defect and Frenkel defect.  i. Vacancy defect :   During crystallization of  a solid, a particle is missing from its regular  site in the crystal lattice. The missing particle  creates a vacancy in the lattice structure. Thus,  some of the lattice sites are vacant because of  missing particles as shown in Fig. 1.12. The  crystal is, then, said to have a vacancy defect.  The vacancy defect can also be developed  when the substance is heated.  Problem 1.6 :   A   compound   forms   hcp  structure.   What   is   the   number   of   (a)  octahedral voids (b) tetrahedral voids (c)  total voids formed in 0.4 mol of it.  Solution :  Number of atoms in 0.4 mol = 0.4 ×   N A  = 0.4 × 6.022 × 10 23   = 2.4098 × 10 23  (a) Number of octahedral voids = number  of atoms = 2.4098 × 10 23  (b) Number of tetrahedral voids  = 2×number of atoms  = 2×2.4098×10 23  = 4.818×10 23  (c) Total number of voids  = 2.409×10 23 + 4.818×10 23  = 7.227 × 10 23  Fig. 1.12 : Vacancy defect  1.8 Crystal defects or imperfections :   The  real, naturally occurring crystalline substances  do not have perfect crystal structures. They  have some disorders or irregularities in the  stacking of atoms. Such irregularities in the  arrangement of constituent particles of a solid  crystal are called defects or imperfections.  Defects are created during the process  of crystallization. The imperfections are more  if the crystallization occurs at a faster rate. It  means that the defects can be minimized by  carrying out crystallization at a slower rate.  In   fact   ideal   crystals   with   no  imperfections are possible only at the absolute  zero of temperature. Above this temperature  no crystalline materials are 100 % pure. They  contain defects.  Whatever be the nature of a crystal defect,  electrical neutrality of the solid is maintained.  It is important to note that sometimes  defects   are   to   be   intentionally   created   for  manipulating   the   desired   properties   in  crystalline solids.
17  It is interesting to note that in this second  case, because of the displacement of a particle a  vacancy defect is created at its original regular  lattice site. At the same time interstitial defect  results at its new position. We can, therefore,  say that in this defect there is a combination of  vacancy defect and self interstitial defect.  This defect preserves the density of the  substance because there is neither loss nor  gain in mass of a substance.  iii. Schottky defect :   In an ionic solid, equal  number of cations and anions are missing  from   their   regular   positions   in   the   crystal  lattice creating vacancies as shown in Fig.  1.15. It means that a vacancy created by a loss  of cation is always accompanied by a vacancy  formed by a loss of anion.  Due to the absence of particles, the  mass of the substance decreases. However,  the volume remains unchanged. As a result the  density of the substance decreases.  ii. Self interstitial defect in elemental solid  Interstitial sites in a crystal are the  spaces or voids in between the particles at  lattice   points.   When   some   particles   of   a  crystalline elemental solid occupy interstitial  sites in the crystal structure, it is called self  interstitial defect.  This defect occurs in the following two ways :  Firstly,   an extra particle occupies an empty  interstitial space in the crystal structure as  shown in Fig. 1.13. This extra particle is same  as those already present at the lattice points.  Fig. 1.13 : Self interstitial defect  Fig. 1.14 : Self interstitial defect  The extra particles increase the total  mass of substance without increasing volume.  Hence its density increases.  Secondly , in an elemental solid a particle  gets shifted from its original lattice point and  occupies an interstitial space in the crystal as  shown in the Fig. 1.14.  Fig. 1.15 : Schottky defect  Thus, there exist two holes per ion pair  lost, one created by missing cation and the  other by a missing anion. Such a paired cation-  anion vacancy defect is a Schottky defect.  Conditions for the formation of Schottky  defect  i. Schottky defect is found in ionic compounds  with the following characteristics :  •   High degree of ionic character.  •   High coordination number of anion  •   Small difference between size of cation  and anion. The ratio   r cation / r anion   is not far  below unity.
18  Consequences of Schottky defect  •   As the number of ions decreases, mass  decreases.   However,   volume   remains  unchanged.   Hence,   the   density   of   a  substance decreases.  •   The number of missing cations and anions  is equal, the electrical neutrality of the  compound is preserved.  This defect is found in ionic crystals such as  NaCl, AgBr and KCl.  iv. Frenkel defect :   Frenkel defect arises when  an ion of an ionic compound is missing from  its regular lattice site and occupies interstitial  position between lattice points as shown in  Fig. 1.16.  The   cations   are   usually   smaller   than  anions. It is, therfore, more common to find  the cations occupying interstitial sites. It is  easier for the smaller cations to accomodate  the interstitial spaces.  Conditions for the formation of Frenkel  defect  •   Frenkel defect occurs in ionic compounds  with   large   difference   between   sizes   of  cation and anion.  •   The   ions   of   ionic   compounds   must   be  having low coordination number.  Consequences of Frenkel defect  •   As no ions are missing from the crystal  lattice as a whole, the density of solid and  its chemical properties remain unchanged.  •   The crystal as a whole remains electrically  neutral   because   the   equal   numbers   of  cations and anions are present.  This defect is found in ionic crystals like ZnS,  AgCl, AgBr, AgI, CaF 2 .  b. Impurity defect :   Impurity defect arises  when foreign atoms, that is, atoms different  from the host atoms, are present in the crystal  lattice. There are two kinds of impurity defects :  Substitutional and interstitial impurity defects.  i. Substitutional impurity defect :   In   this  defect, the foreign atoms are found at the  lattice sites in place of host atoms. The regular  atoms are displaced from their lattice sites by  impurity atoms.  For example :  •   Solid solutions of metals (alloys) :   Brass  is an alloy of Cu and Zn. In brass, host  Cu atoms are replaced by impurity of Zn  atoms. The Zn atoms occupy regular sites  of Cu atoms as shown in Fig. 1.17.  Fig. 1.16 : Frenkel defect  Fig. 1.17 : Brass  It is important to note that the smaller  cation is displaced from its normal site to  an interstitial space. It, therefore, creates a  vacancy defect at its original position and  interstitial defect at its new location in the  same crystal. Frenkel defect can be regarded  as the combination of vacancy defect and  interstitial defect.  Do you know ?  Frenkel defect is not found in  pure alkali metal halides because  cations of allkali metals due to large size  cannot occupy interstitial space.
19  •   Vacancy through aliovalent impurity :  Vacancies are created by the addition  of impurities of aliovalent ions (that is, ions  with oxidation state (o.s.) different from that  of host ions) to an ionic solid.  c. Nonstoichiometric defects :  Nonstoichiometric defect arises when  the ratio of number of atoms of one kind to  that of other kind or the ratio of number of  cations to anions becomes different from that  indicated by its chemical formula. In short,  stoichiometry of the compound is changed.  It is important to note that the change  in stoichiometry does not cause any change in  the crystal structure.  There are two types of nonstoichiometric  defects  i. Metal deficiency defect :   This defect is  possible only in compounds of metals that  show variable oxidation states.  In some crystals, positive metal ions  are missing from their original lattice sites.  The extra negative charge is balanced by the  presence of cation of the same metal with  higher oxidation state than that of missing  cation.  For example, in the compound NiO  one Ni 2 ⊕   ion is missing creating a vacnacy at  its lattice site. The deficiency of two positive  charges is made up by the presence of two Ni 3 ⊕  ions at the other lattice sites of Ni 2 ⊕   ions as  shown in Fig. 1.20. The composition of NiO  then becomes Ni 0.97 O 1.0  Fig. 1.18 : Vacancy through aliovalent ion  Suppose   that   a   small   amount   of  SrCl 2   impurity is added to NaCl during its  crystallization. The added Sr 2 ⊕   ions (O.S. + 2)  occupy some of the regular sites of Na ⊕   host  ions (O.S.+1).  In   order   to   maintain   electrical  neutrality, every Sr 2 ⊕   ion removes two Na ⊕  ions. One of the vacant lattice sites created by  removal of two Na ⊕   ions is occupied by one  Sr 2 ⊕   ion. The other site of Na ⊕   ion remains  vacant as shown in Fig. 1.18.  ii. Interstitial impurity defect :   In this defect,  the impurity atoms occupy interstitial spaces  of lattice structure. For example in steel, Fe  atoms occupy normal lattice sites. The carbon  atoms are present at interstitial spaces, as  shown in Fig. 1.19.  Fig. 1.19 : Stainless steel  Fig. 1.20 : Nonstoichiometric Ni 0.97 O 1.0  ii. Metal excess defect :   There are two types of  metal excess defects.  •   A neutral   atom   or   an   extra   positive  ion occupies interstitial position :   ZnO  presents two ways of metal excess defect.  In the first case in ZnO lattice one neutral
20  Zn atom is present in the interstitial space  as shown in Fig. 1.21(a)  Cl   ions diffuse to the crystal surface  creating vacancies at their regular sites. These  Cl   ions combine with Na atoms on the surface  to   form   NaCl,   by   releasing   electron   from  sodium atom.  Na + Cl   NaCl +e  The electrons released diffuse into the  crystal and occupy vacant sites of anions as  shown in Fig. 1.22. The anion vacant sites  occupied by electrons are F-centres or colour-  centres. Fig. 1.21 (a) : Neutral Zn atom at interstitial  site  Fig. 1.21 (b) : Zn 2+   ions and electrons at  interestitial sites   Fig. 1.22 : An F-centre in a crystal  NaCl shows yellow colour due to the  formation of F-centre.   The crystal of NaCl  has excess Na. The nonstoichiometric formula  of NaCl is the Na 1+x Cl 1.0  1.9 Electrical properites of solids  Can you recall ?  •   What is electrical conductivity ?  •   What is meant by the terms electrical  'insulator' and 'semiconductor' ?  In the second case, when ZnO is heated it  decomposes as :  ZnO   Zn 2 ⊕   + 1/2 O 2   +2e  The excess Zn 2 ⊕   ions are trapped in  interstitial site in the lattice. The electrons also  diffuse in the crystal to occupy interstitial sites  as shown in Fig. 1.21(b).  In both the cases, nonstoichiometric  formula of ZnO is Zn 1+x O 1.0  Can you think ?  When ZnO is heated it turns  yellow and returns back to original  white   colour   on   cooling.   What  could be the reason ?  •   By anion vacancies (Colour or F-centres)  This   type   of   defect   imparts   colour  to the colourless crystal. For example, when  NaCl crystal is heated in the atmosphere of  sodium vapour, sodium atoms are deposited  on the crystal surface.  Solids show very wide range of electrical  conductivity. Accordingly solids are classified  into the following three categories : conductors,  insulators and semiconductors.  i.   Conductors   :   Solids   having   electrical  conductivities in the range 10 4   to 10 7   Ohm -1 m -1  are called conductors. Metals and electrolytes  (ionic   solids)   are   examples   of   electrical  conductors.   Metals   conduct   electricity   by  movement   of   electrons   while   electrolytes  conduct electricity by movement of ions. In
21  They   conduct   electricity   when   electrical  potential is applied.  ii. Valence band :   The band having lower  energy than conduction band is the valence  band.  The electrons in valence band are not  free to move because they are tightly bound to  the respective nuclei.  iii. Band gap :   The energy difference between  valence band and conduction band is called  band gap. Size of the band gap decides whether  electrons from valence band can be promoted  to vacant conduction band or not when band  gap is too large to promote electrons from  valence band to vacant conduction band by  thermal energy, it is called   forbidden zone .  When band gap is small, electrons from higher  energy levels in valence band can be promoted  to conduction band by absorption of energy  (such as thermal, electromagnetic).  Can you recall ?  •   How many molecular orbitals  are formed by interaction of two  atomic orbitals ?  •   What is metallic bond ?  this section we will study some aspects of  electronic conduction of electricity.  ii. Insulators :   Solids having low electrical  conductivities   in   the   range   10 -20   to  10 -10   Ohm -1 m -1   are   called   insulators.   Most  nonmetals and molecular solids belong to this  category.  iii. Semiconductors :   Solids having electrical  conductivities in the range 10 -6   to 10 4   Ohm -1   m -1  are semiconductors. This range is intermediate  between conductors and insulators. Metalloids  like silicon, germanium belong to this category.  1.9.1 Band theory :   Electrical conductivities  of solid metals, nonmetals and metalloids are  explained in terms of band theory. A band  is made of closely spaced electronic energy  levels. Band formation can be correlated to  formation   of   molecular   orbitals   (MOs)   by  interaction of atomic orbitals. (Refer to Std.  XI Chemistry Textbook, chapter 5).  According to MO theory interaction of  atomic orbitals of combining atoms results  in formation of equal number of MOs which  spread over the entire molecule. Similar to  this, interaction of energy levels of electrons in  the closely spaced constituent atoms in solids  result in formation of bands. Band theory  considers formation of two types of bands,  namely, conduction band and valence band.  Another important concept of band theory is  the band gap.  i. Conduction band :   The highest energy band  containing electrons is the conduction band.  It is formed by interaction of the outermost  energy levels of closely spaced atoms in solids.  Conduction band may be partially occupied  or vacant. Electrons in conduction band are  mobile and delocalized over the entire solid.  Do you know ?  The band gap energy values of  a few solids are as shown here.  Solid   E gap   eV  Diamond   5.47  Sodium   0  Silicon   1.12  Germanium   0.67  The   electrical   properties   of   metallic  conductors, insulators and semiconductors are  explained in terms of band theory as follows :  1.9.2 Metals :   Metals are good conductors  of   electricity.   The   outermost   electrons   of  all the atoms in the metallic crystal occupy  conduction band. The number of electrons  in conduction band of metals is large. Hence  metals are good conductors of electricity. The  conduction bands in metals can be further  labelled as 's' band (Fig. 1.23 (a)), overlapping  s and p bands (Fig. 1.23(b)) and so on. This
22  Do you know ?  •   Metallic sodium   is an example of  conductor where the conduction  band is partially filled and there is  no band gap. Electronic configuration of  Na is [Ar]3s 1 . Interaction of the partially  filled 3s AOs of all the Na atoms gives  rise to same number of MOs. All these  closely   spaced   MOs   together   form   a  continuous   band   of   energies   which   is  called 3s band. Lower half of 3s band  corresponds of BMOs and is filled while  the upper half of 3s band corresponds  to AMOs and is empty. There is no gap  depends on the atomic orbitals involved in  band formation. Band formation in metallic  conductors, thus, results in delocalization of  the outermost electrons of all the metal atoms  leaving behind metal ions. This is described as  'cations of metal are immersed in the sea of  electrons'.  Fig. 1.24: Insulators  between these two halves. The 3s band  in sodium is the conduction band which  contains same number of electrons as the  sodium atoms. This is responsible for the  high conductivity of metallic sodium.  •   Metallic   magnesium   is   an   example  of   conductor   with   overlapping   bands.  Electronic   configuration   of   Mg   is  [Ar]3s 2 3p 0 .   Interaction   of   completely  filled 3s AOs of all the Mg atoms gives  rise to the same number of MOs all of  which are filled. These together form the  3s band which is a completely filled band.  Interaction of vacant 3p AOs of all the Mg  atoms gives rise to the same number of  vacant MOs together called 3p band. This  is the vacant band. The filled 3s band and  vacant 3p band overlap each other. As a  result, higher energy electrons move from  3s band to 3p band.  1.9.3 Insulators :   In insulators the valence  band is completely filled with electrons and  the conducation band is empty.  The   valence   band   and   conduction  band in insulators are separated by a large  energy gap called forbidden zone as shown in  Fig. 1.24. Here, thermal energy is insufficient  to promote electrons from valence band to  conduction band.  As   a   result   the   conduction   band  remains vacant. The material is, therefore, an  insulator.  s-band  (a)  p-band  s-band  overlapping bands  (b)  Fig. 1.23: Metalic conductor  The cations of metal atoms occupying  lattice sites vibrate about their mean positions.  At higher temperatures, metal cations undergo  increased vibrational motion about their lattice  sites. The flow of electrons is interrupted by  increased   vibrational   motion.   As   a   result  conductivity of metals decreases with increase  in   temperature.   (Refer   to   Std.   XI   Physics  chapter 11).
23  1.9.4 Semiconductors :   Electrical conductivity  of a semiconductor material is intermediate  between that of metals and insulators. The  metalloids Si and Ge are semiconductors.  Like   insulators,   the   valence   band   in  semiconductor   is   completely   filled   with  electrons   and   conduction   band   is   empty.  However, the energy gap between the two  bands is smaller than that in an insulator. (Fig.  1.25)  the valence band than at lower temperature.  In   fact   semiconductors   are   insulators   at  low   temperatures   and   conductors   at   high  temperatures.  Remember...  Electrical   conductivity   of  metals   decreases   and   that   of  semiconductor increases with increasing  temperature.  1.9.5 Extrinsic semiconductors and doping :  The   conductivity   of   a   semiconductor  can be increased by doping. The process of  addition of minute quantity of impurities to a  semiconductor to increase its conductivity is  called   doping . The added impurity is called  dopant .  A doped semiconductor, having higher  conductivity than pure intrinsic semiconductor,  is an   extrinsic semiconductor .  There   are   two   types   of   extrinsic  semiconductors, namely,   n-type   and   p-type  semiconductors.  i.   n-type   semiconductor   :   n-type  semiconductor contains increased number of  electrons in the conduction bond.  An   n-type   semiconductor   is   obtained  by   adding   group   15   element   to   intrinsic  semiconductor which belongs to group 14.  Fig. 1.25 : Semiconductors  At a temperature above absolute zero a  few electrons in the valence band have enough  thermal energy to jump through the small band  gap and occupy higher energy conduction  band. The conduction band, thus, becomes  partially filled and the valence band becomes  partially empty.  The electrons in conduction band are free  to move. When electric potential is applied to  a semiconductor, it conducts a small amount  of electicity.  Such a pure semiconductor material which  has a very low but finite electrical conductivity  is called   intrinsic semiconductor .  The   electrical   conductivity   of   a  semiconductor   increases   with   increasing  temperature.   This   is   because,   the   number  of   electrons   with   sufficient   energy   so   as  to   get   promoted   to   the   conduction   band  increases as temperature rises. Thus, at higher  temperatures, there are more mobile electrons  in the conduction band and more vacancies in  Can you tell ?  Let   a   small   quantity   of  phosphorus   be   doped   into   pure  silicon.  •   Will the resulting material contain  the same number of total number of  electrons as the original pure silicon ?  •   Will   the   material   be   electrically  neutral or charged ?  Consider,   for   example,   doping   of   Si  with phosphorus. Si has a crystal structure in  which each Si atom is linked tetrahedrally to  four other Si atoms. When small quantity of
24  phosphorous is added to pure Si, the P atoms  occupy some vacant sites in the lattice in place  of Si atoms, as shown in Fig. 1.26. The overall  crystal structure of Si remains unchanged.  contain less number of valence electrons than  that of the pure semiconductor.  Consider, for example, pure Si doped  with   boron.   The   B   atoms   occupy   normal  positions of some of the Si atoms in the lattice  as shown in Fig. 1.28. Boron atom has only  three   valence   electrons.   It   does   not   have  enough electrons to form bonds with its four Si  neighbours.  Four of the five valence electrons of P are  utilized in bonding the closest to four Si atoms.  Thus, P has one extra electron than needed for  bonding. Therefore, Si doped with P has more  number of electrons in the conduction band  than those in the conduction band in pure Si  as shown in Fig. 1.27. It is thus transperent  that the conductivity of Si doped with P is  higher than that of pure Si. The electrons in  conduction band move under the influence of  an applied potential and conduct electricity.  B atom forms bonds with three Si atoms  only. The missing fourth electron creates an  electron vacancy. It is called a   hole .  Fig. 1.28 shows the holes in the valence  band of p-type semiconductor.  A hole has a tendency to accept electron  from its close vicinity. Thus, a hole behaves  as if it has a positive charge. The electrons in  partially filled valence band move under the  influence of an applied potential. The holes  move in the opposite direction.  Fig. 1.26 : P atom occupying regular site of Si  atom  Fig. 1.27 : n-type and p-type semiconductor  Fig. 1.28 : B atom occupying regular site of Si  atom  Remember...  •   Whether intrinsic or extrinsic  semiconductor, the material is  electrically neutral.  •   An n-type semiconductor such as Si  doped with P has more electrons than  those needed for bonding and thus has  electrons in the partially filled conduc -  tion band.  •   A p-type   semiconductor   such   as   Si  doped with B has the less electrons  than needed for bonding and thus has  vacancies (holes) in the valence band.  Because   the   charge   carriers   are   the  increased number of electrons, Si or Ge doped  with group 15 elements such as P, As, Sb or Bi  is an n-type semiconductor.  ii.   p-type   semiconductor   :   A   p-type  semiconductor is produced by doping a pure  semiconductor material (Si or Ge) with an  impurity of group 13 elements. These elements
25  ii. Paramagnetic solids :   The substances with  unpaired electrons are weakly attracted by  magnetic field. These substances are called  paramagnetic substances.  The spinning of unpaired electron gives  rise to a magnetic moment. The substance  is   attracted   by   magnetic   field   because   of  magnetic moment. It is important to understand  that these substances exhibit magnetism in  presence of external magnetic field only. They  lose magnetism when the external magnetic  field is removed.  Oxygen,   Cu 2 ⊕ ,   Fe 3 ⊕ ,   Cr 3 ⊕   are   some  examples of paramagnetic substances.  iii.   Ferromagnetism   :   The   substances  containing large number of unpaired electrons  are attracted strongly by magnetic field. These  substances are said to be ferromagnetic.  These   substances   can   be   permanently  magnetised. They retain magnetism even after  the removal of external magnetic field.  Some   example   of   ferromagnetic  substances are Fe, Co, Ni, Gd, CrO 2 .  Because the charge carriers are holes  which behave like positive charge, the Si or  Ge doped with group 13 elements like B, Ga  or In, is a p-type semiconductor.  1.10 Magnetic properties of solids :   Magnetic  properties of solids can be understood easily  in terms of classical picture of electron. The  electrons   spin   about   their   own   axis.   The  spinning   electrons   act   like   tiny   magnets  because   their   spinning   action   generates  induced magnetic field.  If an orbital contains one electron,  the   unbalanced   spin   exhibits   magnetism.  However,   when   electrons   are   paired   their  spin is balanced and no magnetic property is  observed. On the basis of magnetic properties  solids   are   classified   into   three   major  classes   :   diamagnetic,   paramagnetic   and  ferromagnetic.  i. Diamagnetic solids :   The substances with  all electrons paired, are weakly repelled by  magnetic fields. These substances are said to  be diamagnetic.  Pairing of electrons balances the spins  and hence, cancels their magnetic moments.  N 2 , F 2 , NaCl, H 2 O and benzene are some  examples of diamagnetic substances.  Exercises  1.
